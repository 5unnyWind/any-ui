# Any UI

Any UI is a React-based UI component library that provides rich UI components and styles to help developers quickly build high-quality web applications. In the process of project development, we fully considered the reusability, ease of use and performance of the components, as well as the maintainability and scalability of the code, and followed the best practices and design patterns as much as possible.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm i @any_ui/core
# or
yarn add @any_ui/core
# or
pnpm add @any_ui/core
```
<br/>

```js
import { Button } from "@any_ui/core";

export default () => (
  <>
    <h2>button</h2>
    <Button type="default">default</Button>
  </>
);
```
